Overview:
================================================================================

This directory contains CAMS Global Fire Assimilation System estimated biomass
burning emissions, including information about injection heights derived from
fire observations and meteorological information from the operational weather
forecasts of ECMWF.

FRP observations currently assimilated in this data set are the NASA Terra MODIS
and Aqua MODIS active fire products - 

              (http://modis-fire.umd.edu/pages/ActiveFire.php)

This data set includes: Fire Radiative Power (FRP), dry matter burnt and biomass
burning emissions.

How the NetCDF files were created:
================================================================================

The data set files were created as follows.

1) Retrieve NetCDF format data in half month chunks from ECMWF.

2) Create new NetCDF format data file to contain entire month's worth of data,
   setting 'title', 'conventions', and 'history' attributes as per COARDS.

3) Create output dimensions, converting 'time' from 

                      hours since 1900-01-01 00:00:0.0

   to

                      hours since 1970-01-01 00:00:0.0

   and reversing the sequence of latitude values.

4) For each data set variable:
       - set 'units', 'long_name', 'missing_value'
       - set the modal value in each input half-monthly variable to zero
         (if it is an emission variable), or the output missing value
         otherwise. There does not appear to be a consistent missing value
         in the output from the ECMWF data API for this data set in NetCDF
         format; as this is sparse data, the modal value will be missing data
       - concatenate input half-monthly data, reversing the latitude dimension

4) For the mean altitude of maximum injection variable:
       - where there is no CO emission, i.e. no fire, set mean altitude of
         maximum injection value to the output missing value
       - where is CO emission, i.e. fire, and the mean altitude of maximum
         injection value is between -1.0 and 1.0 (exclusive), set mean
         altitude of maximum injection value to 0.0 (i.e. surface)
       - the above two steps were taken to further clean up inconsistencies in
         missing value in the output from the ECMWF data API for this data set
         in NetCDF format

All variables were compressed at NetCDF 'level 4' when created. Variables were
chunked with the following sizes:

          time/1, lat/1800, lon/3600

as suggested by the GEOS-Chem wiki.
